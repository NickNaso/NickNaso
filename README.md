### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm very passionate Software Engineer. I spent most of my time programming in JavaScript and Node.js. In my spare time I try to give my contribution to Open Source projects and furthermore I'm part of [Node-API](https://github.com/nodejs/abi-stable-node) team, too. I'm actively contributing to [node-addon-api](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api) and recently I started to be interested in the possibility to implement native addons for Node.js using programming languages different form C and C++ and my reasearches pushed me to start a new project called [napi-bindings](https://github.com/napi-bindings). 

Currently, I'm working at Packly as Developer, where for most part of the time I take care of impementing backend systems.

I enjoy speaking at conferences, in the past years I've spoken at Node+JS Interactive in Vancouver, Node+JS Interactive in Montreal, NodeConfEU in Kilkenny, Codemotion in Rome and other local meetups.

In my free time I like to run or go to the mountains to take a long walk.
